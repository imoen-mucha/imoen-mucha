### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This year I took part in the qualification for Nokia Academy 2023 in Krakow for testers :)
I started my adventure with testing because at work I joined the project of transferring the registration and management of complaints in the QM module in SAP to CRM. Currently, at work, I am testing practically how to create complaints in CRM and reporting errors to consultants.
Additionally, I am learning VBA Excel and speaking GPT because I work in SAP every day at my job. I hope VBA will help me make data reporting easier.
Preparing for the AWS cloud practitioner. 
I use Udemy courses the most, I've just finished them at the moment:
- AWS cetrified cloud practitioner
- basics of manual software testing
- python 3 from basics to expert
